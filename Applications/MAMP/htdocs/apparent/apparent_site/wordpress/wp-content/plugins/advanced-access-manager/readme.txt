2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find Access Manager under AWM Group Menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I give access for other Administrators to Advanced Access Manager? =

If you are Super Admin, you can manage the Administrator's Role as other User
Roles. To give an access to Access Manager's Option Page, just create a new
capability <b>AAM Manage</b> and check it for Administrator's User Role.

= My users are not able to edit permalink. What should I do? =

Release 1.6.5 introduced a custom Capability "Edit Permalink". Make sure that
User or User Role has this Capability checked under Capabilities Tab.

= What is "Initiate URL" button, under "Metaboxes & Widgets" Tab? =

Sometimes list of additional metaboxes is conditional on edit post page. Like e.g.
display custom metabox "Photos" only if Post Status is Published. Access Manager
initiates the list of metaboxes for each post in default status ("auto-draft").
That is why you have to manually initialize the URL to the edit post page where
the list of additional metaboxes can be picked by AAM.

= How can I delete created Capability? =

You have to configure Advanced Access Manager behavior with ConfigPress. For more
information please follow the <a href="http://whimba.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2#p2">link</a>

= I unchecked some Menus on "Main Menu" Tab but they are still not shown. Why? =

The reason is that "Main Menu" Tab is not directly related to list of Capabilities.
It means, if you selected/deselected some Menu or Submenu it will not add or delete
correct capabilities for current User Role. In such way if you want to give somebody
access to backend I recommend to use predefined set of options "Editor" and then
just filter Main Menu.
